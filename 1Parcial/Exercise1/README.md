# Create Naive Multiplication in C  matrix by matrix

To multiply two matrices, we need to follow set of rules. we have two matrices A and B, with dimensions m x n and n x p, respectively. The resulting matrix C will have dimensions m x p.

Hereâ€™s how to calculate the elements of C:

For each element in the resulting matrix C, take the dot product of the corresponding row in matrix A and the corresponding column in matrix B.
Add up the products from step 1 to get the value of the element in C.

- [ ] 1
- [x] 2
- [ ] 3
